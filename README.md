# Launcher
Just a simple console application, which can launch files/apps, so you dont have to find the file and double click it everytime :v
Type `new` and add a display name and path to the file/app that u want to launch and it will save that to the folder %appdata%/GameSparkerz/. somewhere here.


#### Requires .NET Framework v4.6.1
### Windows only
