# Launcher
Just a simple console application, which can launch files/apps, so you dont have to find the file and double click it everytime :v
Type new and add a display name and path to the file/app that u want to launch and it will save that to the folder %appdata%/GameSparkerz/. somewhere here.

*Made it cuz i am too lazy.* There are alot of bugs and crashes and i wont be fixing them, mayb, idk. And... It does not have any GUI.

#### Requires .NET Framework v4.6.1
